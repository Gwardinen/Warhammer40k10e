# WH40k10e Manifests

Use these URLs to import (and link) the manifest in Rosterizer in the manifest import dialog. Import the base 40k manifest first in order for dependencies to resolve automatically.

If you're going to author stuff for 40k, it's wise to make it similar in structure to other 40k manifests.
